```{r}

m = 10e4

y = numeric(m) # create the vectors we will fill in with simulations
phi = numeric(m)

for (i in 1:m) {
  phi[i] = rbeta(n=1, shape1=2.0, shape2=2.0)
  y[i] = rbinom(n=1, size=10, prob=phi[i])
}
# which is equivalent to the following 'vectorized' code
phi = rbeta(n=m, shape1=2.0, shape2=2.0)
y = rbinom(n=m, size=10, prob=phi)

```{r}

#If we are interested only in the marginal distribution of y
# , we can just ignore the draws for Ï•
#  and treat the draws of y
#  as a sample from its marginal distribution.
